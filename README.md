Hello! My name is Clarice Helena Fran√ßa. I am 30 years old, I have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Chemistry and I am currently studying Data Science at EBAC.

With an analytical profile that I have been developing since college, I decided to transition to the data area, which I have been falling in love with with each module studied and project completed.

This is my space for collaboration and more learning. It will be a pleasure to have you as a colleague on this journey!
